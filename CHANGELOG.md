# Changelog

All notable changes to Cumea are documented here. This project follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and uses semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13 — Developer Preview

### Added

- Persistent named agents with Claude, Codex, Grok, Gemini, and Box-backed provider adapters.
- Agent-to-agent handoffs, durable tasks/runs/tool steps/artifacts, reusable routines, and a
  consolidated Needs-you approval inbox.
- Local macOS and optional user-provided cloud computer surfaces, plus optional connected-app
  actions through Composio.
- A self-hosted Expo companion with secure one-time pairing, an agent-list home, per-agent chat,
  approvals, routine status, attachment upload, revocation, and capability-gated screen preview.
- Persistent customizable Mote-based avatars with semantic working, waiting, success, and error
  states, including reduced-motion behavior.
- Linux and Windows preview packaging configuration with explicit feature degradation.

### Security

- Removed upstream telemetry and remote identity collection.
- Hardened local HTTP boundaries, navigation, external links, JSON/static-file handling, secret
  projection, provider process spawning, configuration permissions, and atomic persistence.
- Kept remote/mobile access opt-in, separately authenticated, least-privilege, and documented for
  deployment only behind user-controlled HTTPS or a private tunnel.

### Release evidence boundary

- `v0.1.0` is a **Developer Preview**, not a production-support claim.
- The first binary target is macOS arm64. CI may build an unsigned unpacked app to verify package
  contents, but that does not prove launch behavior, code signing, notarization, or Gatekeeper
  acceptance.
- Linux and Windows receive portable source checks only until hands-on package and desktop testing
  is recorded. Local computer control and dictation remain macOS-only.
- The Expo typecheck and JavaScript export are source-distribution checks. No iOS/Android signed
  build, physical-device, VoiceOver/TalkBack, push/background, or store review is claimed.
- A release must not be tagged or published until the exact candidate commit satisfies
  [the release checklist](docs/releasing.md). Results from a dirty checkout or another commit are
  not release evidence.
